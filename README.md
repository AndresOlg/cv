**My Curriculum Vitae in an App**

This time I wanted to make an experiment in order to increase my skills in react-native, because is a new technology for me, and I think that only practice makes a master.

I don't know is there is another similar project. I supposed, but I don't care, because my target is to learn, no to make the best of the best application in the world.

So, I thought that it could be fun take my CV, and make it like an App, no just a pretty PDF.

I decided make a little project, but using almost the same tools that I use to handled in my regular projects.

According to this target, I need first of all, what I want, and I drawn the next sketch:

I decided to put the basics: A little profile, some education, my favorite skills, and of course, some experience.

Then, I made a piece of conceptual application architecture (I'm not an architect, but I to like play pretending to be one) to have a clearer panorama about the final result, so, I got this:

So, at this point, I got enough information to make some mockups for every interface.

5 mockups, each one for every module that I defined at the beginning of this article.

Now I need to create some of the activities that I'll do.

This part is a little complex, so, I'm going to simplify the process. I'm gonna make a basic baseline (without dates) with some activities per interface, and I'm gonna put them on Trello, which is a pretty good tool for get a Kanban board.

I made an structure to define the project better. I know, is an small project, maybe doesn't require so much, but, I'd rather this way to avoid noise in my execution.

Through the above list, I trying to define every stage on my project. Some of them are done, another are on the way, and the rest is waiting.

In less than 140 characters, is just a little document that explain that I'm making an application with client side, and server side.

I hope to publish it at least in the play store.

Now, is time to write the EDT (not an strict one, course), in order to make all the activities that Trello require.

This is the final version for this project. I tried to be concise, but, at the same time, pragmatic (very) in order to get the final goal in a realistic way. Although, I tried involve almost all the stages considered in a more complex project.

Now, I'm ready to put the activities in my board (I mean, Trello).

Meanwhile, I've been had worked in the code, and at the time of write this lines, I already got the layout of the Splash, and the Profile Interface, at least in their first version each one.
