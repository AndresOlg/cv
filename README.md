**My Curriculum Vitae in an App**

This time I wanted to make an experiment in order to increase my skills in react-native, because is a new technology for me, and I think that only practice makes a master.

I don't know is there is another similar project. I supposed, but I don't care, because my target is to learn, no to make the best of the best application in the world.

So, I thought that it could be fun take my CV, and make it like an App, no just a pretty PDF.

I decided make a little project, but using almost the same tools that I use to handled in my regular projects.

According to this target, I need first of all, what I want, and I drawn the next sketch:

I decided to put the basics: A little profile, some education, my favorite skills, and of course, some experience.

Then, I made a piece of conceptual application architecture (I'm not an architect, but I to like play pretending to be one) to have a clearer panorama about the final result, so, I got this:

So, at this point, I got enough information to make some mockups for every interface.

5 mockups, each one for every module that I defined at the beginning of this article.

Now I need to create some of the activities that I'll do.

This part is a little complex, so, I'm going to simplify the process. I'm gonna make a basic baseline (without dates) with some activities per interface, and I'm gonna put them on Trello, which is a pretty good tool for get a Kanban board.

I made an structure to define the project better. I know, is an small project, maybe doesn't require so much, but, I'd rather this way to avoid noise in my execution.

Through the above list, I trying to define every stage on my project. Some of them are done, another are on the way, and the rest is waiting.

In less than 140 characters, is just a little document that explain what I'm making an application with client side, and server side.

I hope to publish it at least in the play store.

Now, is time to write the EDT, in order to make all the activities that Trello require.
