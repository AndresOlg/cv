My Curriculum Vitae in an App

This time I wanted to make an experiment in order to increase my skills in react-native, because is a new technology for me, and I think that only practice makes a master.

I don't know is there is another similar project. I supposed, but I don't care, because my target is to learn, no to make the best of the best application in the world.

So, I thought that it could be fun take my CV, and make it like an App, no just a pretty PDF.

I decided make a little project, but using almost the same tools that I use to handled in my regular projects.

According to this target, I need first of all, what I want, and I drawn the next sketch:

I decided to put the basics: A little profile, some education, my favorite skills, and of course, some experience.

Then, I made a piece of conceptual application architecture (I'm not an architect, but I to like play pretending to be one) to have a clearer panorama about the final result, so, I got this:

So, at this point, I got enough information to make some mockups for every interface.

5 mockups, each one for every module that I defined at the beginning of this article.
