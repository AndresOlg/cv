I don't know how to star to write this one, but, in order to publish the app to Play Store, I have to make a policy privacy,
because there is a request for to use READ_PHONE_STATE. Actually, my app doesn't requiere any data, any access from the mobile
as well. I'm going to require Internet permission when I start to load the data from a server, but not yet.

But, somehow, that permission is added in the procces of create the APK. I'm going to solve that, but right now I need this
document.

So, I think I need to be clear, I'm not going to extract any data to whoever install the application. At least from me, I'm 
not going to use privacy data from anybody, because this app only has a unique purpose: Present myself like a mobile developer,
and to learn more and more React Native.

That's all. I hope this can be useful.
